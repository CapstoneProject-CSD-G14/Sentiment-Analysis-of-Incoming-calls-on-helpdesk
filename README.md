# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Incoming-calls-on-helpdesk

The *Sentiment Analysis of Incoming Calls on Helpdesk* project aims to enhance customer service by analyzing the sentiment of customer interactions using speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP). The system records incoming calls, transcribes speech into text, and classifies sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. By leveraging a Flask-based web application, businesses can visualize sentiment trends, monitor customer satisfaction, and identify service gaps in real-time. This enables proactive decision-making, improves response strategies, and enhances overall service quality. With automated call analysis and centralized data storage, organizations can optimize customer engagement, refine support operations, and drive long-term business growth.
